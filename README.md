# Matheus "Matt" Pratta

Hello there! I'm Matheus, sometimes also called Matt, a full-stack developer currently working part-time at [Tecnoblog](https://tecnoblog.net) and also running my own company, [Subatomic](https://subatomic.rocks) for freelancing and developing my own ideas. I mostly do back-end work, in languages such as PHP and JavaScript, but I also have some experience working on front-end development, specially with SCSS and Vue.js. As a secondary skill, I also know something about design, color theory and image editing, and I mostly use these to enhance prototypes and development work, but not as a primary skill.
